# Commercial Usage

A **commercial license** grants you full ownership and control over your products,
and saves you from having to conform to our open-source requirements and restrictions.

When you purchase a commercial license, you'll also have direct contact with the engineers who built Keywork.

A ‘commercial use’ license is mandatory as soon as you develop commercial activities involving the Keywork software without disclosing the source code of your own applications.
